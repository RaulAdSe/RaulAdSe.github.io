Hey, I'm Raul. 

My career path? Picture drunk-navigating home at 3am — taking every possible detour, walking into a few walls, but somehow ending up exactly where you needed to be.

---

Started with Engineering Physics because I wanted to understand how the universe works. Turns out, the universe is complicated. So I narrowed it down to just understanding how brains work. 

(Easy, right?)

Spent years at fancy places like Max Planck Institute and TUM Munich modeling neural networks — the biological kind, before transformers ate the world. My research was basically figuring out why rats can't stop hitting the cocaine lever. 

Fun fact: It's the same neural circuit that keeps you scrolling TikTok at 2am.

Had three PhD offers on the table:
- TUM Munich
- UPC Barcelona  
- Industrial PhD at a Barcelona startup

You know that meme about the guy sweating over which button to push? That was me. Except all the buttons led to 4+ years of researching stuff that maybe 50 people in the world care about.

The weight of committing to one future when you can see three different timelines? Paralyzing.

So I did what any rational person would do — rejected all three and decided to try tech instead.

My CV full of cool math and research?

**Got absolutely destroyed by ATS filters.**

Zero interviews. Nada. Zip.

So naturally, I built a bot to spam LinkedIn with applications using OpenAI's API. Barely knew what I was doing, but somehow went from 0 to 20 interviews per week.

First it was just close friends asking: "Hey, can you run that bot for me?"

Then their friends. 

Then THEIR friends. 

Before I knew it, half my hometown was sliding into my DMs asking for the magic job-hunting robot.

That little rebellion caught someone's attention. A local engineering firm had a wild proposition:

> "Hey, you seem good at building things. Want to build our entire digital infrastructure from scratch?"

Challenge accepted.

**365 days later:**
- From "what's an API?" to shipping features daily
- 20+ people depending on my platforms daily
- Data pipelines processing hundreds of documents
- Search systems across thousands of files
- Burned through enough AWS credits to make Bezos smile

Failed fast. Learned faster.

Building from scratch rewired my brain. 

There's this moment — usually at 2am, running on coffee and stubbornness — when your hacky prototype suddenly works. That rush? Pure addiction.

Now I can't unsee it. Every broken process is a startup waiting to happen. Every "that's just how we do things" makes my eye twitch. 

(My girlfriend has officially banned "you know what would be cool?" from dinner conversation.)

What really gets me is the energy. That raw, chaotic force when someone's building something from nothing.

I'm obsessed with understanding:
- How founders spot opportunities everyone else misses
- What makes them push through when logic screams stop
- How they survive the technical hell of scaling from 10 to 10,000 users
- Why their database melted at 3am (and what they learned from it)

While everyone's consuming Silicon Valley content from afar, Barcelona has incredible founders building right here, right now. 

So I started grabbing coffees with founders. Turns out the best startup stories aren't in TechCrunch — they're happening two metro stops away.
