## Why this blog 

Everyone's obsessed with Silicon Valley, but Barcelona's tech scene is building a similar future for 1/3 the salary and somehow we're... happier?  Yeah, we can't afford a Tesla, but we can afford therapy because we actually have time to go. Different compensation, different problems.

After countless hours doomscrolling Hacker News, checking every YC batch company, and upvoting things on Product Hunt I'll never use, I decided to touch grass. This blog is my excuse to enjoy great coffee with Barcelona's founders and document their journeys.

**No pitch decks. No "we're the Uber for X" pitches. Just authentic conversations about:**
- How they're actually building their products
- The problems keeping them up at night (besides the coffee)
- The unglamorous reality behind the LinkedIn success posts

My superpower? I've lived in both worlds - academic research and startup chaos. I can go from discussing Hebbian plasticity to debugging a memory leak in production. That weird combination lets me ask different questions and spot patterns others might miss.

If you're into startups, curious about Barcelona's tech ecosystem, or enjoy stories of people building amazing things against all odds - grab a coffee and stick around.

*P.S. - If you're a founder in Barcelona building something interesting, let's grab coffee. I promise to only ask mildly uncomfortable questions.*
