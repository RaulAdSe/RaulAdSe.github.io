## Your Hiring Process Is Optimized For People Who Don't Exist

It's 2 AM. You're a delivery driver finishing your shift. Your phone buzzes.

**Option A:** Email from "noreply@careers-portal.jobvite.com"  
*"Thank you for your interest in the Delivery Associate position. Please create an account on our careers portal, upload your resume in PDF format, and complete our 47-question application. Our team will review within 3-5 business days."*

You delete it without reading past the first line.

**Option B:** WhatsApp message  
*"Hey! Maria here from [Company]. Saw you applied for the driver position. You free for a quick 5-min call tomorrow? Or we can just text if that's easier. Whatever works üöó"*

You reply while walking to your car.

Guess which company fills their positions in days instead of weeks?

## The Founder Who Survived Hiring Hell

Met Sergi Bastardas between meetings. He's coming off a ‚Ç¨6.4M seed round led by Visionaries Club, with AT&T and Verisure as customers, and about 47 other fires burning simultaneously.

But I want to talk about his previous company: **Colvin**.

Online flower delivery. Scaled to ‚Ç¨50M revenue. 350 employees. 6 markets.

"When you're scaling that fast," Sergi told me, "most of your hiring isn't engineers. It's delivery drivers. Warehouse staff. Customer service reps working night shifts. You need to hire fast, and they all have one thing in common."

I waited.

"They're on their phone checking WhatsApp. They're not on LinkedIn. They're not checking email. They're working two jobs and they'll ghost your interview if you make them jump through hoops."

He paused. "And every hiring tool on the market is built like those candidates don't exist."

**This pissed him off enough to build a company about it.**

A quick note on founder archetypes: Most of my founder coffees have been with technical founders‚Äîpeople who code, who dream in architecture diagrams, who get excited about latency optimization. Sergi is different. He's a business operator. The kind of founder who knows how to scale revenue, manage P&L across six markets, negotiate enterprise deals, and make sure the machine doesn't break when you go from 50 to 350 employees in two years. He didn't write the Orbio codebase (that's Antonio's domain), but he knows exactly what needs to be built, who will pay for it, and how much they'll pay. This is the classic pairing: technical founder builds the engine, business founder steers the ship and makes sure there's fuel in the tank. Most successful startups have both. The technical founder gets frustrated when the business founder "doesn't understand why this feature is hard." The business founder gets frustrated when the technical founder "doesn't understand why this customer matters." When they figure out how to work together‚Äîlike Sergi, Nacho, and Antonio clearly have‚Äîthat's when shit actually scales. You need someone who can close AT&T while someone else is optimizing voice latency. Different problems. Both critical.

## The Market Everyone Ignores

Pop quiz: What do these companies have in common?

- Verisure (security guards across Europe)
- Honest Greens (restaurant staff)
- Vicio (kitchen + delivery teams)
- AT&T (call center reps)
- Every warehouse, retail store, and delivery company you've ever used

**They're all desperately trying to hire people who:**
- Don't have LinkedIn profiles
- Check WhatsApp 50 times a day, email once a week
- Work when you work (so "schedule a call Tuesday at 2 PM" is useless)
- Need a job NOW, not after your 4-week interview process
- Are phone-first (no laptop required)

**Your hiring stack:**
- Applicant Tracking System built in 2015 
- "Careers portal" that requires creating an account 
- Email-based communication 
- Calendar scheduling tool 
- LinkedIn Recruiter 

**Your candidates:**
- Never opening your emails ‚ùå
- Not creating accounts on your portal ‚ùå
- Checking WhatsApp between shifts 
- Working 2-3 jobs 
- Need async communication 

**You're playing chess. They're playing a completely different game.**

And you wonder why you have a 70% no-show rate.

## Maria: The Agent That Meets People Where They Actually Are

Orbio's core product is Maria. Not a "scheduling assistant." Not an "AI interviewer." An agent that genuinely doesn't care about your process‚Äîonly about **actually connecting with candidates**.

Here's what that looks like:

**Traditional Hiring Flow:**
```
Application ‚Üí Auto-reply email ‚Üí Wait 3 days ‚Üí 
Calendar invite ‚Üí Candidate working, misses it ‚Üí 
Reschedule email ‚Üí Another calendar invite ‚Üí 
Candidate confirms, forgets ‚Üí No-show ‚Üí 
Give up, next candidate
```

**Time to completed interview: 7-14 days (if ever)**

**Maria's Flow:**
```
Application ‚Üí WhatsApp within minutes: "Hey! Can we chat?" ‚Üí 
Quick back-and-forth to find a time ‚Üí 
Call that evening ‚Üí Done
```

**Time to completed interview: 4-8 hours**

But here's what makes it actually work:

üìû **Mid-conversation channel switching**  
Start on WhatsApp. Candidate says "actually, can you call me in 20 minutes?" Maria calls back. Exactly on time. Then follows up via text with details.

All one conversation. Seamless.

üí¨ **True async**  
Candidate responds between deliveries. Maria doesn't care. Picks up the conversation exactly where it left off. No "sorry, we moved on to other candidates."

üåç **60+ languages**  
Not Google Translate. Actually understanding cultural context and local labor law nuances.

‚è∞ **24/7 across time zones**  
Security guard works nights? Maria works nights. Weekend shifts? Maria works weekends.

The magic isn't the AI. **The magic is respecting that people have lives.**

## The Numbers That Prove This Isn't Vaporware

**Four months since launch.**

- **60,000+ interviews completed**  
  Not scheduled. Not attempted. *Completed.*

- **99% candidate satisfaction**  
  The people being interviewed actually like it.

- **99% client satisfaction**  
  The companies hiring also like it.

Getting dual 99% satisfaction in hiring is like finding a unicorn riding another unicorn. Everyone usually hates something about the process.

- **80% faster time-to-hire**  
  Days, not weeks. Sometimes hours.

- **AT&T, Verisure, Honest Greens, Vicio as customers**  
  Enterprise from day 1, not "we'll figure out B2B later."

Let me explain why that candidate satisfaction number matters.

**Nobody likes being interviewed.** It's inherently stressful. You're being evaluated. There's a power imbalance.

Getting 99% satisfaction means they're doing something fundamentally different:

 Flexible timing (not "Tuesday 2 PM or never")  
 Their preferred channel (not "email only")  
 Async-friendly (life happens)  
 No weird games or trick questions  
 Fast feedback (not radio silence)  
 Actually feels conversational  

It's almost like treating candidates like **humans with constraints** instead of **resources to be processed**.

Wild concept.

## The Team That Isn't Playing

Quick founder background check:

**Sergi Bastardas (CEO)**
- Built Colvin: ‚Ç¨50M revenue, 350 employees, 6 markets
- Actually hired hundreds of delivery drivers, warehouse staff, customer service reps
- Knows exactly where hiring processes break (because he watched them break repeatedly)

**Nacho Traves√≠ (CRO)**  
- Co-founded Cobee (employee benefits platform)
- **Sold to Pluxee Group**
- Knows enterprise HR sales

**Antonio Mel√© (CTO)**
- Founded Nucoro (fintech)
- **Sold to Backbase** (3,000+ engineers)
- Built systems that scale

**Pattern recognition time:**  
All three have exits. All three have scaled companies. All three know exactly which mistakes to avoid.

This isn't their first rodeo. It's their "we know what we're doing now" rodeo.

## What I Actually Learned

This is my third founder coffee in three weeks. Patterns emerging:

### **1. The Best Founders Lived the Problem**

- **Supersonik:** Daniel automated a $15M business because manual processes offended him
- **Prosper:** JM spent 10+ years drowning in US healthcare bureaucracy
- **Orbio:** Sergi hired 350 people and watched traditional tools fail spectacularly

You can't out-research someone who **survived the problem for years**.

### **2. Everyone's Optimizing the Wrong Market**

The entire tech world is fighting over:
- AI coding assistants
- Productivity tools for knowledge workers
- DevOps automation

Meanwhile, **80% of the workforce** is getting ignored:
- Delivery drivers checking WhatsApp between routes
- Security guards working night shifts
- Warehouse workers on break
- Restaurant staff juggling schedules

**Massive market. Terrible tools. Nobody paying attention.**

### **3. WhatsApp Isn't a Feature. It's the Strategy.**

"We support WhatsApp" ‚â† "We're WhatsApp-first"

Most tools: Email-first, WhatsApp as afterthought  
**Orbio: WhatsApp-first, email because some people still use it for some reason**

Meet users where they are. Not where you wish they were.

### **4. Second-Time Founders Move Different**

First-time founders: "Let's learn and iterate!"  
Second-time founders: "We know exactly what matters. Ship it."

All three Orbio founders have exits. They're not experimenting. They're executing.

### **5. The Boring Stuff Is the Moat**

Everyone wants to build the flashy demo.  
Nobody wants to build:
- GDPR compliance systems
- Multi-channel state management
- Enterprise security audits

**The boring stuff is what lets you charge enterprise prices.**

---

The future of work isn't just about AI writing code or automating email.

**It's about dignity.**

Making sure the person delivering your lunch doesn't have to fill out a 47-question application and wait a week for a response.

Making sure the security guard working nights can interview on their schedule, not yours.

Making sure the warehouse worker between shifts can handle hiring via WhatsApp without needing a laptop.

**Everyone's optimizing for the knowledge worker checking Slack between meetings.**

Sergi looked at everyone else and said: "They deserve better tools too."

And then he built them.

60,000 interviews in 4 months. Not tech hiring that takes 3 months. **Volume hiring happening daily.** Security teams filled in days. Restaurant staff onboarded across cities.

The unglamorous, essential work of keeping civilization running.

While everyone argues about whether LLMs can replace junior engineers, Orbio shipped an agent that can hire 50 customer service reps in a week.

**Different problem. Bigger market. Actual impact.**

The best startups aren't about solving obvious problems.

They're about noticing the problems **everyone accepts as unchangeable** and saying "this is bs."
