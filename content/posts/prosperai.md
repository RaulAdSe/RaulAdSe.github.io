## The Problem Nobody Wants to Talk About

You know that special circle of hell where you're on hold with your insurance company, listening to muzak that sounds like elevator music got drunk and had a fight with a MIDI keyboard, wondering if you'll qualify for Medicare by the time someone picks up? 

Yeah. Multiply that by **4 million calls per day** across US healthcare.

Welcome to the invisible crisis that Prosper AI is trying to solve. Not the sexy "ChatGPT but for X" stuff you see on Twitter. The unglamorous, brutally complex, soul-crushing world of healthcare phone calls that literally nobody wants to deal with—but everyone desperately needs fixed.

(Seriously, if you've ever called your insurance company to check if your doctor is "in network," you know this pain intimately. It's like playing Russian roulette but all the chambers are loaded with bureaucracy.)

## Setting the Scene: Where Healthcare Tech Meets Luxury Retail

I met Josep Marc Mingot (JM) at Prosper's Barcelona office, which shares a building with a high-end jewelry store. 

The aesthetic whiplash is real. You walk past displays of diamond necklaces that cost more than my car, take the elevator up, and suddenly you're in startup land—engineers debugging phone call failures and optimizing containment rates.

It's very "we're solving billion-dollar problems but our office neighbors are selling literal diamonds." The décor is on point though. Can't fault them there.

(I like to imagine confused tourists occasionally wandering into the wrong floor looking for engagement rings and instead finding a whiteboard covered in IVR flow diagrams.)

---

## The Founder's Path: From MIT to "Actually, Let's Build Something"

JM's career trajectory reads like someone who kept rolling dice until they landed on the exact right problem.

MIT. Computer vision research. PhD offer on the table—the kind of opportunity most people would kill for.

And then he said... no.

Instead, he went into consulting, doing ML and modeling for insurance companies when "machine learning" still made people think you were talking about assembly lines. This was *before* it was cool, before every company slapped "AI-powered" on their landing page. Then he became in love with product world and pivoting ideas in his startup journey.

This is where the story gets interesting: JM and his co-founder Xavier are both Spanish, but they'd been living in the US for some time. Long enough to really *understand* the American healthcare system in all its bureaucratic glory. Long enough to experience the pain points firsthand. Long enough to know where the money is.

He started exploring ideas with Xavier (Harvard business guy—we all need that one friend who went to an Ivy League to make us look more legitimate). Spent over a year trying different concepts in the same space—customer service operations in complex industries.

But they kept circling back to something they already knew intimately: **insurance calls**.

"We'd already explored this space," JM explained. "We knew the workflows. We understood the pain points. We'd seen how broken the system was from both sides—as consumers and as consultants working with these companies."

The insight that crystallized everything: **Healthcare isn't just another vertical. It's a different game entirely.**

(Translation: They chose the hardest possible version of this problem. But at least they chose one they actually understood.)

---

## The Unfair Advantage: Living the Problem for a Decade

Here's the thing that keeps coming back in our conversation: JM and Xavier aren't outsiders trying to understand US healthcare. They're insiders who got fed up and decided to fix it.

**Ten years in the US** means:
- They've personally experienced the nightmare of navigating insurance
- They understand American healthcare culture in ways Europeans typically don't
- They know which pain points actually matter (versus which ones just *sound* important)
- They understand where the money flows and who has budget authority

**Years working with insurance companies** means:
- They've seen the systems from the inside
- They know what technology these companies actually use (spoiler: it's not cutting edge)
- They understand the compliance requirements viscerally, not theoretically
- They know which problems are "annoying" versus "would pay six figures to solve"

This isn't a "we read about this problem on Hacker News and thought it sounded interesting" situation. This is "we've been neck-deep in this mess for over a decade and we know exactly where the bodies are buried."

Their previous pivots have were always in the customer service, insurance world. That's the kind of domain expertise you can't fake. And in a space as complex as healthcare, it's the difference between "neat demo" and "shut up and take my money."

## Why Healthcare Voice AI is Actually Incredibly Hard

I walked into this conversation thinking, "Cool, voice AI for healthcare, how hard can it be?"

*Narrator: It was, in fact, very hard.*

JM proceeded to give me a masterclass in why healthcare voice AI is to regular chatbots what brain surgery is to making a sandwich.


![Healthcare Voice AI](/healthcare_voice.png)



**The fun stuff you're dealing with:**

- **IVRs from 1995** that were probably coded by someone who thought Y2K was gonna end civilization (and might change without warning)
- **PHI/PII compliance** where one mistake = lawyers descending like locusts
- **Real-time integration** with 80+ different EHR systems, each with their own special flavor of chaos
- **Life-or-death accuracy** requirements (because "sorry we hallucinated your prior authorization status lol" doesn't really fly when someone needs their insulin)

"When you call a payer," JM explained with the weary patience of someone who's explained this 1,000 times, "you're not just dealing with ASR/TTS latency. You're navigating Byzantine IVR menus designed by people who clearly hate humanity, handling holds that can last 20+ minutes—"

"—while listening to that music—"

"—*exactly*, dealing with accents, background noise, AND the fact that if you mess up a member ID, someone literally doesn't get their medication."

Cool cool cool. No pressure. Just people's actual healthcare on the line.

## The Market: So Big It's Stupid

Let's talk numbers because they're genuinely absurd:

- **4 million healthcare admin calls per day** in the US 
- **$450B wasted annually** on administrative overhead (that's not a typo)
- Current market leaders doing maybe **1-2 million calls per year**

Do the math. The biggest player is handling 1-2 million calls annually in a market that generates 4 million **per day**.

"There's so much room," JM said, and I swear I could see the spreadsheet calculations happening behind his eyes. "The market isn't winner-take-all. There's space for multiple winners because the volume is just *insane*."

Even if Prosper captured 10% of the market, that's **400,000 calls per day**. 

(I tried to do the revenue math in my head and my brain just made that Windows error sound.)

The beautiful part? The market is **expanding**, not shrinking. As healthcare systems digitize, call volumes don't decrease—they just... shift. Prior authorizations, eligibility checks, claims follow-ups—all of this still requires phone calls because the infrastructure is fundamentally broken and held together with duct tape and prayers.

And JM and Xavier knew this. Not from market research reports, but from living it. From watching the system buckle under its own weight year after year. From seeing the same problems persist despite everyone agreeing they need to be fixed.

"When you've been in the US healthcare system for over a decade," JM said, "you stop being surprised by how broken it is. You just start thinking about how to fix it."

It's like trying to modernize a house but discovering the foundation is just more house. Welcome to American healthcare!

## The Genius Move: Helping, Not Threatening

Here's where Prosper's strategy gets really smart.

They're not trying to *replace* call center staff. They're not coming in saying "fire your humans, we'll do it cheaper."

They're handling **the overflow**—the calls that would otherwise go unanswered because the call center is already at capacity.

Think about it: A hospital call center gets 1,000 calls a day. Their staff can handle 700. What happens to the other 300?

Right now? They either go to voicemail (and never get returned because who has time?), or patients keep calling back, creating even more volume, creating a death spiral of unanswered calls and frustrated people.

**Prosper handles those 300 calls.**

The ones that would've been *lost* anyway. The overflow. The volume spikes during flu season or after a billing cycle.

This is **brilliant** for several reasons:

**1. Zero threat to existing staff**
You're not taking anyone's job. You're handling calls they couldn't have taken anyway. The call center workers aren't thinking "oh no, robots are coming for us"—they're thinking "thank god, we're drowning here."

**2. Easy sell to management**
"Pay us only when we successfully resolve a call that would've otherwise gone unanswered" is a *very* easy pitch. There's no downside. It's pure upside.

**3. Proof of concept built-in**
Start with overflow. Prove the system works. Build trust. *Then* expand to other use cases. It's a trojan horse strategy, but the good kind.

**4. Aligned incentives everywhere**
- Staff aren't threatened → less resistance
- Management sees clear ROI → faster adoption
- Patients get answers → better experience
- Prosper only gets paid for resolved calls → everyone wins

This strategy didn't come from an MBA textbook. It came from JM and Xavier's decade of experience understanding how healthcare organizations actually make decisions, what their real constraints are, and what kind of value propositions actually get through procurement.

It's almost too elegant. Like finding out the hard problem has a side door that nobody was guarding—and you only know about it because you've been walking past that building for ten years.

## Competition: Three Flavors of "Good Luck With That"

Prosper faces competition from three distinct angles, each with their own special way of saying "this is fine" while everything burns:

### **1. Horizontal Voice AI Platforms: Jack of All Trades, Master of None**

These are companies building general-purpose voice agents for any industry. Order a pizza? They got you. Book a haircut? Easy. Navigate the hellscape of healthcare administration?

*Eh.*

**Their problem?** They might get you 10% containment (calls completed without human intervention) across industries, which sounds great until you realize healthcare needs 50-60%+ with near-perfect accuracy on fields that, if you mess them up, can literally prevent someone from getting surgery.

"A horizontal platform can't compete on depth," JM explained. 

It's the difference between being conversationally fluent and being "I can order beer in seven languages" fluent.

### **2. Healthcare-Specific Competitors: The Others Who Chose Pain**

Companies like **Infinitus** and **Notable Health** playing in the same space.

**Infinitus:** Strong in prior authorization. Their vibe? Humans + machines working together, like a buddy cop movie but for insurance claims. Solid approach, just fundamentally different from Prosper's "let the robots handle the overflow" model.

**Notable Health:** Broader automation suite. They're doing the "we'll help your whole contact center" play.

**Prosper's differentiation:**

- **>50% fully autonomous containment** (their robots don't need adult supervision)
- **Pricing model:** They charge **per successfully resolved call**—you only pay when it actually works (more on this later because it's genuinely brilliant)
- **Speed to value:** Live in ~3 weeks with real integrations (not "we'll get back to you after our Q3 planning meeting")
- **Dual focus:** They handle both **patient-facing calls** ("Hi, this is your appointment reminder!") AND **payer-facing calls** ("I'm calling about prior authorization status for..."). Most competitors pick one.
- **Non-threatening deployment:** They take the overflow, not the core volume
- **Deep domain expertise:** Over a decade in US healthcare and insurance, from both sides

"We're the only ones doing both," JM noted, with the casual confidence of someone who knows they're playing 4D chess while everyone else is still figuring out checkers.

Patient calls and insurance calls are completely different beasts—different workflows, different pain points, different compliance requirements—but the underlying infrastructure is the same. That's **leverage**.


### **3. Incumbent Healthcare Software: The Dinosaurs**

The big EHR vendors (Epic, Cerner) and legacy call center software companies.

**Their advantage:** Distribution. They're already in every hospital, probably running on servers installed during the Bush administration. (The first one.)

**Their problem:** They move with the speed of continental drift. 

"These companies take 6 months just to have a planning meeting," JM said, and I could hear the disbelief in his voice, like he still couldn't quite believe it was real.

"Meanwhile, we ship features weekly."

Plus, adding voice AI isn't just a "let's add this feature" thing for them—it requires **rethinking the entire product architecture**. They're hamstrung by legacy decisions made when flip phones were cutting edge and "the cloud" meant weather.

Good luck with that architectural overhaul, enterprise software dinosaurs! 

(This is why startups exist, by the way. Incumbents are too busy maintaining their Jenga tower of legacy code to innovate.)

---

## The Tech: Not Just "LLM Goes Brrr"

Here's where it gets technically spicy.

Prosper doesn't just throw an LLM at the problem and pray. (Though let's be honest, that's half of what passes for "AI innovation" these days.)

They use **FSM (finite-state machines) + LLM orchestration**—a hybrid approach that's like having a rebellious teenager (the LLM) with strict but reasonable parents (the FSM).

**Why this matters:**

- **Deterministic paths** for critical fields (DOB, member ID, SSN—stuff you CANNOT mess up)
- **Grammar constraints** to prevent hallucinations on structured data (because "I think your birthday is maybe in July?" isn't gonna cut it)
- **Tool-first design** where the LLM chooses from pre-validated functions, not freestyle improv
- **Smart escalation** to humans when confidence drops below "we're pretty sure" territory

They're not trying to eliminate humans. They're building a system where **machines handle the 60-70% of straightforward cases**, and humans focus on the edge cases that actually need judgment.

Think of it like triage in an ER. The AI handles the "yeah, that's just a cold" cases. Humans get the "wait, is that actually a heart attack?" cases.

**The metrics that actually matter:**

- Containment rate (% of calls completed without human intervention)
- Task completion (did we actually get all the info?)
- Critical-field accuracy (did we mess up anyone's DOB?)

Not just "did the call finish?" but "did we capture everything correctly AND write it back to the right system without corrupting someone's medical records?"

---

## Pricing: The "Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is" Model

This is genuinely brilliant and cuts straight through the industry nonsense.

Most voice AI companies charge by:
- **Minutes of call time** (incentivizes longer calls—great for them, terrible for you)
- **Number of attempts** (incentivizes spam calling until something works)
- **Flat monthly fees** (no accountability, just vibes)

**Prosper charges per successfully resolved call.**

Read that again.

They only make money when they **actually solve the problem**.

Call failed? You don't pay.  
Took 5 attempts to reach the payer? You don't pay extra.  
Agent got stuck in an IVR hell loop? That's Prosper's problem, not yours.

Combined with their overflow strategy, this creates a genuinely risk-free proposition:

"We'll handle the calls you can't take anyway. You only pay when we successfully resolve them. If we don't resolve them, they were going to go unanswered regardless, so you lose nothing."

How do you say no to that?

This aligns incentives perfectly:
- Prosper is motivated to maximize containment and accuracy
- Customers pay for outcomes, not effort
- No weird optimization games (like artificially extending calls to juice revenue)
- Zero risk for the customer—pure upside

"It's simple," JM said with a shrug. "If we do a great job, we make money. If we don't, we don't. That forces us to actually be good at this."

And this pricing model? It came from years of understanding how healthcare organizations think about ROI, what procurement actually cares about, and how to structure deals that get through the Byzantine approval processes.

You don't learn that from Y Combinator. You learn that from a decade in the trenches.

It's the startup equivalent of "pics or it didn't happen."

I love it.

## The Team Structure: Smart People Doing Smart Things

Prosper is 9 people split between NYC and Barcelona. (Because why pick one coast when you can complicate your life with transatlantic coordination?)

But the way they're organized is actually clever:

### **Forward Deployment Engineers (3-4 people):**

These folks are part consultant, part engineer, part product manager, part therapist. They:
- Work directly with clients to understand their workflows (read: figure out what the heck is actually happening in their call centers)
- Take **windmill workflows**—those beautiful, complex, client-specific processes—and adapt them for each customer
- Customize voice agents for specific use cases
- Measure performance in production (the "oh god what broke" dashboards)
- Continuously iterate based on real data
- Handle the "why did this call fail?" investigations (detective work, but for robots)

The windmill workflows are the key here. Each pharmacy, hospital, each clinic, each specialty practice has their own unique way of doing things. Prior authorization at Hospital A looks different from Hospital B. The Forward Deployment team doesn't try to force everyone into the same mold—they adapt the system to match how each client actually works.

### **ML Engineers / Backend Devs (3-4 people):**

These are the people building the actual magic:
- Provide the tools and platforms for the Forward Deployment team
- Build the orchestration layer, evaluation pipelines, observability systems
- Optimize for latency, cost, and reliability
- Make sure the system scales without catching fire

**The division of labor is clean:**
- **Forward Deployment** = product + customization 
- **ML/Backend** = infrastructure + tooling 

This lets them move fast without everyone constantly stepping on each other's toes. Forward Deployment can ship custom workflows without waiting for Backend to rebuild the universe. Backend can improve the platform without breaking every client integration.

It's like having a pit crew and a driver. One builds the car, the other makes sure it doesn't crash.

---

## What I Learned (The Meta Insights That Keep Me Up at Night)

**1. Domain Expertise is an Unfair Advantage**

JM and Xavier spent **over 10 years** living and working in US healthcare. That's not something competitors can replicate quickly.

You can hire consultants. You can do customer discovery. But you can't compress a decade of lived experience into a few months of research.

When they talk to potential customers, they're not learning the problem—they're demonstrating they already understand it better than the customer does.

That's power.

**2. Vertical > Horizontal (At Least For Now)**

General-purpose voice AI platforms will get better. But right now, deep domain expertise in healthcare creates a **massive moat**.

Why? Because healthcare's complexity doesn't simplify—it *compounds*. Every new payer integration is slightly different. Every hospital has its own windmill workflows. Every state has different regulations.

Horizontal players are spread thin across industries trying to be okay at everything. Prosper is going **deep** in one massive market and getting better with every client.

And they're doing it from a position of strength—they already explored insurance calls extensively before. They know the patterns. They know the pitfalls.

**3. Market Size > Market Share**

When the total addressable market is **4 million calls per day** and current leaders are doing **1-2 million per year**, you don't need to "win" the market to build a unicorn.

You just need to execute reasonably well and not mess it up.

There's enough room for multiple winners. The pie is so absurdly large that even a modest slice is a feast.

**4. Pricing = Strategy = Signal**

Charging per successfully resolved call isn't just customer-friendly—it's a **forcing function for excellence**.

It's the startup equivalent of saying "I'm so confident this works that I'll literally only charge you when it does."

That's the kind of pricing model you can only offer when your product *actually works*. It's a signal. A flex. A dare to competitors.

"Match this, cowards."

**5. The Overflow Strategy is Genius**

By focusing on calls that would go unanswered anyway, Prosper eliminates the biggest objection to automation: "what about our people?"

There's no threat. No job displacement. Just... handling the work that wasn't getting done.

It's almost too clean. The perfect wedge strategy.

And it came from understanding how healthcare organizations actually make decisions—knowledge that only comes from being in the system for years.

**6. Team Structure Enables Speed**

Separating Forward Deployment (customization + windmill workflow adaptation + client success) from ML/Backend (infrastructure + tooling) prevents bottlenecks.

Engineers aren't getting pulled into client calls. Client-facing folks aren't blocked waiting for infrastructure. Everyone can move at their own speed.

It's like having separate swim lanes. Sure, you occasionally need to coordinate, but mostly everyone can just *go*.

**7. Compliance is a Feature, Not a Bug**

HIPAA, BAAs, audit logs, redaction—these aren't annoying obstacles.

They're **differentiators**.

Startups that build this in from day one have a huge advantage over those trying to retrofit it later. ("Oh shoot, we should probably not log people's social security numbers in plaintext" is not a conversation you want to have after you've already been logging them for two years.)

**8. The Boring Stuff Matters Most**

Flashy demos get you attention. Boring infrastructure gets you customers.

What actually ships products?
- Robust eval pipelines with golden test sets
- Observability and incident runbooks
- Validators that catch dumb edge cases
- Clean handoffs to humans with full context

The stuff that makes Reddit posts go "meh" is what keeps production systems from catching fire at 3am.

**9. Speed Compounds**

Prosper went from idea → YC S23 → $5M seed in ~2 years. They're shipping features weekly, onboarding clients in weeks, and iterating faster than incumbents can schedule a meeting to discuss scheduling a meeting.

That's not luck.

That's choosing the right problem *that you already understand intimately*, building the right team, and **executing relentlessly**.

**10. Know Where the Money Is**

After 10+ years in the US, JM and Xavier don't need to guess about market dynamics. They know:
- US market rules
- Which pain points have budget allocated
- Who has decision-making authority
- What ROI thresholds matter
- How procurement processes actually work
- Where the real money flows in healthcare

That's not MBA knowledge. That's battlefield intelligence.

## Final Thoughts 

Talking with JM reminded me why I started this whole thing.

Everyone obsesses over Silicon Valley unicorns and whatever Sam Altman tweeted this morning. Meanwhile, here in Barcelona (and NYC, and everywhere else), there are founders building genuinely hard technology that solves real problems for real people.

No nonsense. No hype cycles. Just:
- Deep technical challenges that make your brain hurt
- Measurable impact on actual humans
- A team that genuinely gives a darn
- Founders who've lived the problem 

The healthcare voice AI market is **massive**, **underserved**, and **ripe for disruption**. Prosper is moving fast, pricing smart, and building deep moats through vertical expertise.

If you're an engineer who wants to work on something that matters—where your code directly affects whether someone gets their medication on time, where production bugs have actual consequences, where you're solving genuinely hard problems—Prosper is worth checking out.

If you're a founder building in healthcare or adjacent spaces, pay attention. This is how you build defensible moats in 2025: **depth over breadth, lived experience over market research, execution over hype, and real value over vaporware.**

And hey, if you're looking for office space, maybe find a building with a jewelry store. Apparently it works.

---

*P.S. — Yes, I nerded out about FSM + LLM orchestration for way too long in this conversation.*

*P.P.S. — Seriously though, if you've ever tried to call your insurance company, you know this problem is real. Prosper might actually fix it. And they're solving it from a place of deep understanding, not just opportunity. That matters.*
